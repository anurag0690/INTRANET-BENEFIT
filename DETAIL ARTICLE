our company intranet might hold the key to many of the internal challenges your organization is struggling with. Are you taking full advantage of it?

An intranet (not to be confused with the internet) is a local or restricted network that enables employees to store, organize, and share information within an organization

The problem is that many organizations have dismissed the idea that their intranet can be extremely useful

In a recent study, 80% of employees working in medium and large-sized organizations said their company has an intranet, and that it is a tool they rely on regularly.

In fact, 81% had used it in the last week. That is the good news.

he bad news is that this tool that employees rely on regularly is still slowing them down. The same report uncovered these surprising stats:

43% of employees avoided sharing a document with a colleague because they could not find it or believed it would take too long to find.

Only 29% of employees knew how to submit an idea.

Only 30% knew how to request resources from another team.

Less than 25% knew where to find their corporate brochure.

Only 50% knew how to submit an IT request or book a vacation.
