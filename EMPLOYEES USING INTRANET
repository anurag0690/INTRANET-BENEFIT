Unlike email and instant messaging, a company intranet is a central source of truth for things like company communication, forms & templates, policies, and procedures

Every business is different, but here are things almost every intranet has

Corporate news, alerts, KPIs, and leadership communication

Links to most used applications

A place for new employee onboarding

Benefits and payroll site

Forms, Templates, policies, and Procedures

Employee directory

Learning and development section
Since so many people see the homepage, avoid making it merely a placeholder or another hoop to jump through to get to where employees need to go.
