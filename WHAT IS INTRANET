What is an intranet?
An intranet is a platform companies use as an internal network.
You could think of it as a privately-held version of the internet that contains information, apps, and tools that employees need to send and receive information, collaborate with their teams, and generally accomplish their daily work. 
ntranets enable remote work, allowing companies to connect employees to the people and resources they need to stay connected and productive. 
Without an intranet, employees may struggle to find the information or answers needed to move forward.

Intranets eliminate these challenges, accelerating timelines and making work more efficient for all stakeholders. 

Sharing and storing information is one of the intranet’s greatest advantages, as it ensures the most recent versions of documents are available to access.
